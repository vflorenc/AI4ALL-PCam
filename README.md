# AI4ALL PatchCamelyon (PCam) Project
To get started with the project in Google Colab
Go to colab.research.google.com , open a new notebook, and run these commands:

  ```
  from google.colab import drive
  drive.mount('/content/drive')
  !cd /content/drive/My\ Drive
  !git clone https://github.com/vflorenc/AI4ALL-PCam.git
  ```
  
It may take a second, because the repository contains our dataset.

Once the download finishes, go to Google Drive and open the folder called "AI4ALL-Pcam".

The notebooks should be in this folder - start with 00_Introduction.ipynb. Right click > Open with > Colaboratory
